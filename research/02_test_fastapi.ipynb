Hopefully, you’ve found something\\nthat meets your needs and budget. In case you want to keep looking for the perfect pair of cat ear\\nheadphones, here’s a shortlist of things to consider when buying cat ear headphones.\\nMost of the cat ear headphones have the same basic shape, with those cat ears on top of the\\nheadband. However, you can choose between on-ear and over-ear models, you can pick the color you\\nlike, you can choose the model with or without LED lights. Some models will have the lights in only one\\ncolor while others will have multi-color LED lighting.\\nDon’t raise your hopes too high. Most of these headphones are cheap and made of plastic. In our\\nopinion, you can consider yourself lucky if they last for more than a year. It’s not only the headband and\\nthe cups that are cheap. Most of these headphones also use cheap drivers and have poorly executed\\ninternal wiring.\\nIf you are buying headphones for your child, you should pay attention to the size. You have special\\nheadphones that are made for children. The headphones for children are not only smalle. They are also\\nmade of stronger and safer materials (like the food-grade silicone) and they have some child-friendly\\nfeatures (like volume-limiting technology). \\nIf you are buying the headphones for you, you should also pay attention to fit and comfort. For some\\nreason, many of these headphones are not very large and, if you have a larger head, you may feel\\nsome discomfort. \\nWell, this entirely depends on your needs and budget. Wired headphones are usually cheaper but the\\nprice difference is not huge. Some wired models come with a detachable mic and their cables have\\nin-line controls. If you find any of these features important, you should look for headphones that support\\nthese features.\\nRecommended Reading :\\n Wireless headphones usually come with a detachable cable that you can use when you run out of\\njuice. Also, most of them have built-in mics that you can use in wireless mode.\\nIf you are looking for wireless cat ear headphones, you have to pay attention to Bluetooth version,\\npairing, range, and connection reliability. Also, you should pay attention to supported Bluetooth codecs\\nsince they can tell you if the headphones are compatible with iOS devices. If they support the AAC\\ncodec, they are definitely compatible with iOS.\\nThe battery life (playtime) varies between 4-9 hours, depending on the price of headphones and usage.\\nYou will get longer playtime if the LED lights are off or if you decide not to use the speakers built into\\nthe cat ears (only some headphone models have these speakers). So, none of these wireless cat ear\\nheadphones offer amazingly long playtimes. \\nWe have already said that most of these cat ear headphones use cheap drivers. So, you can’t expect\\nincredibly detailed reproduction, strong bass, sparkling highs. You will get average sound quality and\\nyou will have to deal with it. Some cat ear headphones sound better than others but none of them can\\nbe considered great.\\nAs mentioned previously, most of the cat ear headphones are made by unknown generic brands and\\nthey are usually quite cheap. Many wired cat ear headphones are priced under $50. Some are priced\\nunder $20. The most expensive cat ear headphones come from Brookstone and Razer. These are the\\nonly headphones on our list (and probably, on the market) that are priced over $100.\\nYes, cat ear headphones are very popular within the gaming community.\\nIt will depend on which device you’re connecting the headphones to. If it’s to a smartphone, you should\\nbe able to connect the device via the settings app. Similarly, you can connect these to a Windows or\\nMac via the computer settings.\\nIn our opinion, it depends on the desired use, but our favorite on the list is the Razer Kraken Kitty\\nthanks to its build and sound quality.\\nThese are the 15 best cat ear headphones in 2023. The price range is quite wide in the market for this\\nkind of product, so you should definitely be able to find a pair that suits your budget.\\nBefore making a purchase, consider what features are important to you: Bluetooth connectivity, USB\\nreceiver, virtual surround sound, and so on. The best pair will depend on what you plan on using them\\nfor: gaming, casual music listening, etc.\\n', metadata={'page': 30, 'source': 'output.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Here’s a rundown of the 10 best cat ear headphones that will make you feel all kawaii\\nHeadphones nowadays come in different shapes and sizes. Some may look more like your average\\nheadphones but some are much more unique — perhaps with flashing LEDs and cat ears.\\nKitty headphones or cat ear headphones have gained popularity through the years and you may want\\none for your own reasons. However, if you tried to buy one right off the bat, you may have learned the\\nhard way that choosing one is not easy. Apart from their unique design, you also have to consider\\nwhat’s inside to make sure that you’ll enjoy using them.\\nLucky for you, once you know what to actually look for, it will be easier. More than that, once you find\\nout which cat ear headphones are the best, all you really have to do is choose. So, that’s what we’re\\ngoing to do here!\\nCat ear headphones trace their roots to the Japanese concept of Nekomimi. This is a type of moe\\nanthropomorphism in Japanese anime or manga where human characters are given cat-like qualities.\\nThis includes sharp teeth, feline tails, and, yes, cat ears. It was started in 1924 by a novelist and\\nchildren’s literature author named Kenji Miyazawa.\\nIn Western pop culture, there is also a concept of feline characters led by the infamous Catwoman from\\nDC Comics. Other characters who exhibit cat-like behaviors are DC’s Cheetah and Marvel’s Black Cat.\\nFast forward to 2014. An animé artist named Wenqing Yan was working on an animation where she\\nstarted designing cat ear headphones. This was where the seed was planted. Together with her\\nco-founder and then best friend, Victoria Hu, they sought to make these cat ear headphones a reality\\nand set the wheel in motion.\\nThe cat ear headphones are close to becoming a reality!

Raising the fund is just one part of the puzzle. Manufacturing\\nthe product at scale is a whole different monster. This is where the partnership took a big downfall.\\nThrough her written account Looking Back, Looking Onward on DeviantArt.com, Yan chronicled the\\nevents that took place from the conception of the idea up until earning her success.\\n“A year ago in 2014, at this time, I was frantically trying to resolve the Axent Wear manufacturing\\nissue… My best friend at the time, and co-founder of Axent Wear (Victoria Hu), had promised to\\nprovide manufacturing for the headphones but when I actually visited the factory she had set up, I\\nfound out it was a horrendous sweatshop with workers breathing lead.\\nI told her that was not acceptable and that she needed to provide a humane and environmental\\nalternative. She initially agreed, but ended up ignoring me while I was stuck in China waiting for her\\nreplies. Communication completely broke down and we never recovered even after I returned to\\nAmerica to speak with her in person.”\\nLong story short, they went through a legal battle. Although it did not come to a redressed ending, Yan\\nwas left to push the product forward.\\nAfter learning about the whole situation, Brookstone reached out to Yan with a partnership proposal at\\nhand, particularly to help Yan in the production of the headphones. For Yan, it was a no-brainer deal.\\nBrookstone had the capacity to deliver on the promise of high-quality production, while cat ear\\nheadphones already had the attention of major media outlets.\\nFast forward to October 30, 2015, the first pair of Axent Wear Cat Ear Headphones was finally shipped\\nto the backers.\\nUnfortunately, Brookstone’s supposed capacity to deliver high-quality headphones didn’t pan out well.\\nIn an effort to make the special headphones happen with a limited budget, most models turned out\\nfaulty and had to be returned.\\nThe pool of unsatisfied customers created a market gap that other competing brands quickly\\nrecognized. Before you know it, big names such as Razer started jumping onto the trend with their own\\nKraken Kitty.\\nWhether you are an otaku, streamer, gamer, or just someone who wants to wear something uniquely\\ncute on your head, cat ear headphones would be a great addition to your look.\\n', metadata={'page': 0, 'source': 'output.pdf'}), Document(page_content='According to us, the best cat ear headphones/headset on the list is the Razer Kraken Kitty RGB USB\\nGaming Headset.
