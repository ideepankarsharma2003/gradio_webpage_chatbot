       "'{\"paragraphs\":[\"Here’s a rundown of the 10 best cat ear headphones that will make you feel all kawaii\",\"Headphones nowadays come in different shapes and sizes. Some may look more like your average headphones but some are much more unique — perhaps with flashing LEDs and cat ears.\",\"Kitty headphones or cat ear headphones have gained popularity through the years and you may want one for your own reasons. However, if you tried to buy one right off the bat, you may have learned the hard way that choosing one is not easy. Apart from their unique design, you also have to consider what’s inside to make sure that you’ll enjoy using them.\",\"Lucky for you, once you know what to actually look for, it will be easier. More than that, once you find out which cat ear headphones are the best, all you really have to do is choose. So, that’s what we’re going to do here!\",\"Cat ear headphones trace their roots to the Japanese concept of Nekomimi. This is a type of moe anthropomorphism in Japanese anime or manga where human characters are given cat-like qualities. This includes sharp teeth, feline tails, and, yes, cat ears. It was started in 1924 by a novelist and children’s literature author named Kenji Miyazawa.\",\"In Western pop culture, there is also a concept of feline characters led by the infamous Catwoman from DC Comics. Other characters who exhibit cat-like behaviors are DC’s Cheetah and Marvel’s Black Cat.\",\"Fast forward to 2014. An animé artist named Wenqing Yan was working on an animation where she started designing cat ear headphones. This was where the seed was planted. Together with her co-founder and then best friend, Victoria Hu, they sought to make these cat ear headphones a reality and set the wheel in motion.\",\"The cat ear headphones are close to becoming a reality! More info here http://t.co/TDRkIK1vQE pic.twitter.com/4UL6W9yMbi\",\"— Wenqing Yan (@Yuumei_Art) May 9, 2014\",\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\",\"However, the story didn’t just end there. Raising the fund is just one part of the puzzle. Manufacturing the product at scale is a whole different monster. This is where the partnership took a big downfall.\",\"Through her written account Looking Back, Looking Onward on DeviantArt.com, Yan chronicled the events that took place from the conception of the idea up until earning her success.\",\"“A year ago in 2014, at this time, I was frantically trying to resolve the Axent Wear manufacturing issue… My best friend at the time, and co-founder of Axent Wear (Victoria Hu), had promised to provide manufacturing for the headphones but when I actually visited the factory she had set up, I found out it was a horrendous sweatshop with workers breathing lead. \",\"I told her that was not acceptable and that she needed to provide a humane and environmental alternative. She initially agreed, but ended up ignoring me while I was stuck in China waiting for her replies. Communication completely broke down and we never recovered even after I returned to America to speak with her in person.”\",\"Long story short, they went through a legal battle. Although it did not come to a redressed ending, Yan was left to push the product forward.\",\"After learning about the whole situation, Brookstone reached out to Yan with a partnership proposal at hand, particularly to help Yan in the production of the headphones. For Yan, it was a no-brainer deal. Brookstone had the capacity to deliver on the promise of high-quality production, while cat ear headphones already had the attention of major media outlets.\",\"Fast forward to October 30, 2015, the first pair of Axent Wear Cat Ear Headphones was finally shipped to the backers.\",\"Unfortunately, Brookstone’s supposed capacity to deliver high-quality headphones didn’t pan out well. In an effort to make the special headphones happen with a limited budget, most models turned out faulty and had to be returned.\",\"The pool of unsatisfied customers created a market gap that other competing brands quickly recognized. Before you know it, big names such as Razer started jumping onto the trend with their own Kraken Kitty.\",\"Whether you are an otaku, streamer, gamer, or just someone who wants to wear something uniquely cute on your head, cat ear headphones would be a great addition to your look.\",\"However, choosing the best one is not just a question of design or color. You also need to consider things such as compatibility, sound quality, mic quality, and more. This makes things a little more challenging — but not if you know what to look for.\",\"The design is the biggest buying factor for cat ear headphones because it is their defining feature. After all, cat ear headphones without the cat ears are just, well, your typical headphones.\",\"Different manufacturers design and integrate the cat ears of their products differently. Some cat ears can be thick, some can be pointed, while some can even be soft and fluffy. The choice is up to you!\",\"Another defining feature of cat ear headphones are their LED lights. These colorful RGB lights complete the whole experience and would seriously make you feel like your favorite streamers. LED lights are often placed on the ear cups, on the headband, on the mic, or even on the cat ears themselves.\",\"The LED light isn’t there just to illuminate the headphones. They also add another layer to the design that you can also customize to your liking. If you like this idea, then you need to get headphones that offer adjustability in this department.\",\"Some kitty headphones allow you to change the colors you see around the headphones. Because of this, you can easily display your favorite color. Headphones today typically have RGB lights which, through combinations, can result in around 12 more colors.\",\"Color changes are usually done through a companion app where you can select a specific color. In some headphones, you can also change the colors through the buttons.\",\"After changing the color of the light, you can also change the light mode to add more groove and funk. Light modes pertain to the pattern in which the lights move. For example, you can have the lights blink, change colors, swivel around, and more!\",\"Like changing the color, you can also change light modes through a companion app or through button combinations on the headphones. Some headphones may limit you to around 2-3 patterns but if you want more choices, you can get headphones that allow for more light modes.\",\"The Music Sync is a special light mode. As the name suggests, this mode is where the lights on the headphones would follow the music being played. To be exact, the lights would flicker or move up and down to follow the beats or rhythm of the music.\",\"Since this is still technically a light mode, you can access this through a companion app or perhaps a button on the headphones. However, this feature is quite advanced so don’t expect all of the kitty headphones out there to have this.\",\"Cat ear headphones sold today can come in wireless or wired connectivity, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages.\",\"Wired headphones tend to provide higher sound quality than wireless ones. This is because manufacturers of wired headphones can allot more budget to developing sound quality without thinking about spending for wireless technology. Furthermore, wired headphones use analog signals that can handle more data than digital signals like Bluetooth.\",\"With wired headphones, you also wouldn’t need to worry about battery life. Plus, you can easily fix broken wires at home.\",\"On the other hand, wireless headphones offer freedom of movement and portability. They usually connect wirelessly through Radio Frequency (RF), Infrared Frequency (IF), or Bluetooth. But, Bluetooth headphones get access to some of the latest features like multipoint connectivity and Bluetooth tracking.\",\"Wired and wireless headphones also have different devices they are compatible with.\",\"Wired headphones can connect to different devices depending on the type of jack that they have. Headphones today usually come in a 3.5mm jack but there are those that have interchangeable connections that can accommodate even USB ports. The more options the headphones offer, the better.\",\"Wireless headphones, especially those powered by Bluetooth, are a little bit more flexible. Bluetooth headphones can connect to any device that is Bluetooth ready — which is basically any smartphone, tablet, or even laptop out there.\",\"However, the case is different for gaming consoles as they tend to be a little trickier to connect to. For example, connecting headphones to your PS4 is easier said than done because you can’t just plug in or connect the headphones and expect it to work. You have to rummage around the setting to change the sound output first.\",\"It gets even more complicated with Xbox One because you can’t exactly use any ordinary headphones for this console. Instead, you’ll either need to use any of these compatible XBox headphones only or buy a dedicated Xbox Bluetooth Audio Transmitter instead.\",\"For cat ear headphones, design is the priority and sound quality is only second to that. But, that doesn’t mean that you should go and buy anything that’s a sorry excuse for headphones — sound-wise.\",\"Let’s admit it, you won’t find studio-quality headphones with cat ears on them. Still, you should look into some specific sound factors when deciding on which headphones to buy. You want headphones that are clear and accurate enough — as simple as that.\",\"Clarity refers to how much detail you could hear through the headphones. Good clear headphones will help you hear every syllable of the vocals and every sound made by the instruments properly.\",\"Accuracy, on the other hand, refers to how close to the original sound you can hear. This is achieved through a more neutral soundstage that let’s the sounds be what they were meant to be and not exaggerated through the equalizer.\",\"Other than clarity and accuracy, some special features can also make the sound quality and overall listening experience better. Watch out for features such as Surround Sound, Volume Limits, and Noise Cancellation. Let’s go over them one by one!\",\"Surround Sound is a feature that creates an immersive audio experience by using multiple channels to mimic a lifelike sound field. To simply put it, surround sound gives that effect that you are actually surrounded by sound — front to back, left to right, and all around.\",\"This feature is an improvement from the more traditional stereo sound. Compared to surround sound, stereo sound is a lot less immersive because the sound would evidently come from the left and right sides only. Surround sound also utilizes subwoofers that produce sound waves undetectable by the ears but can be felt by the body to add to the experience.\",\"If you’re using your cat ear headphones for gaming, having surround sound would be very helpful. Other than making the sound deeper and more immersive, this feature will also make you aware of where the sounds are actually coming from. So, let’s just say nobody will sneak behind you successfully anytime soon.\",\"Because of their cute design, cat ear headphones appeal to kids. As you may know, kids have a more delicate sense of hearing compared to adults so it’s important to protect them from possible damage. Volume limits can help you with that.\",\"Even if you’re an adult already, you still need to protect your ears from damage.\",\"As the name suggests, volume limit is a feature that prevents headphones from exceeding a safe level of listening volume. For reference, the ears can safely tolerate 90db for up to 2 hours. As sound levels increase, listening time that is considered safe decreases. Volume limits prevent users from exceeding around 85db.\",\"This is one of the latest features you can find in high-end headphones today. In fact, people even try to make noise cancelling headphones at home.\",\"Noise cancellation helps the users focus only on what they want to hear without having to turn up the volume to max levels to try to drown out outside noise. There are two types of noise cancellation — passive noise cancellation and active noise cancellation.\",\"Passive noise cancellation, or noise isolation, physically blocks out the noise by using thicker materials to enclose your ears. You can say that this is the more natural way of blocking noise, but it’s a little less effective than active noise cancellation.\",\"Active noise cancellation or ANC is more advanced and smarter because it relies on negating sound waves instead of just physically blocking them out. Because of this, ANC headphones are much more effective in preventing external noise from getting inside your ears while you’re listening.\",\"However, some may find the lack of ambient sound with noise cancellation unnatural. Let’s admit it, not everyone wants to feel like they’re in a soundproof room. This is one of the ways noise cancellation affects sound quality. To solve this, some noise-cancelling headphones have different modes to let users control how much outside noise they want to let in.\",\"In the end, with noise cancellation, you’re more likely to get a safe and immersive listening experience, and free from distractions.\",\"These days, a lot of people, including you, are relying on the internet to communicate with people. Whether you’re talking to your teammates in-game, catching up with your friends online, or presenting at work, good mic quality is a must.\",\"Luckily for you, it’s not unusual to find cat ear headphones with mic/s so your concern now is on the quality. When it comes to this, the most basic thing to look for is clear audio. You don’t need to sound like your favorite artists, you just need to prevent people from saying “what?” every time you say something.\",\"Mics today come in two forms – built-in or booms.\",\"Headphones with built-in microphones often have the mic system integrated along the wire. Because of this, built-in microphones are also called in-line microphones. In this case, this mic is usually positioned between the neck and the chest of the user. For wireless headphones, built-in microphones are usually positioned on the ear cup.\",\"On the other hand, boom mics protrude out of the ear cup. They are positioned close to the mic but can often be repositioned or retracted if not in use.\",\"Between the two, boom mics are more likely to produce better mic quality for various reasons. First, because of their close proximity to your mouth, boom mics can capture what you’re saying clearly. Boom mics also boast of a more advanced mechanism that is able to gather more audio data than in-line microphones.\",\"Also, not to put in-line microphones down but they tend to rub against your body and produce that shushing sound that can be annoying for those who are hearing you.\",\"Although comfort is arguably a subjective matter, it should not be taken lightly. Comfort can be a deciding factor whether the cat ear headphones you got are worth it or not.\",\"Buy something that ends up hurting your ears and you would probably need to spend on another product again. Buy something that fits and feels well and you would probably use them multiple hours a day for years.\",\"For comfort, you should look into the headphone’s adjustability, weight, and size. Decide on these three properties properly and you should be able to find something comfortable enough.\",\"People have different ear shapes and sizes. In fact, our ears are so unique that they can be used as a way to identify people the same way that fingerprints do. So what does this mean for headphones?\",\"To simply put it, this means that the whole idea of one-size-fits-all is not really true. What you may find comfortable out of the box can be annoyingly uncomfortable to others. So, this is where adjustability comes in.\",\"Adjustability enables users to have a chance at a comfortable listening experience. The more adjustable the headphones are, the higher the chances that you would find a comfortable combination of settings.\",\"Generally speaking, headphones with good adjustability would at least allow the following:\",\"Weight is also a crucial factor in comfort. If you use heavy headphones for hours while gaming or watching a movie, don’t get surprised if you wake up the following day with a strained neck.\",\"The added weight of the cat ears themselves can make this tricky for kitty headphones. Even without the cat ears, headphone manufacturers already have a challenging time creating lightweight headphones.\",\"Ideally, headphones should weigh below 0.55 lbs. Anything above 0.75 lbs is already considered ‘heavy’.\",\"The weight of the headphones is also related to their clamping force. Clamping force pertains to how tight the headphones press onto your head. If your headphones are heavy, the weight would pull the whole thing down and the clamping force would have to compensate in order to keep the ear cups in place. This will cause ear fatigue and pain along the ear cartilage called the pinna.\",\"With proper clamping force, the headphones would feel lighter. For reference, clamping force should fall between 0.7 lbs to 1.74 lbs.\",\"Cat ear headphones have a very diverse market that includes both kids and adults. Because of this, some kitty headphones are kids-size and no amount of adjustment will make these amenable for adults.\",\"Lucky for you, headphone brands would declare whether their headphones are for kids or for adults. This information is often disclosed in the package so be sure that this is one of the first things you’ll check before buying the product.\",\"Cat ear headphones may have started out as a novelty item for Neko fans or otakus, but it sure isn’t limited to them now. These days, because of the attractive and attention-grabbing design, female gamers or streamers often use this as well. There’s also the fact that gamers or streamers like to watch anime and are otakus themselves.\",\"Cat ear headphones are also popular among kids today and that’s not necessarily because they watch anime. Kitty headphones are simply cute and comical which makes them at home on kids’ heads.\",\"\",\"When you talk about cat ear headphones or headphones in general, you just couldn’t avoid talking about Razer and their Kraken Kitty. The Razer Kraken Kitty is the cat-eared representative of the notorious Razer Kraken Family.\",\"The Kraken Kitty are wired gaming headphones that connect through a USB-A type of connection. If you’re more of a wireless person, you’ll be glad to know that these headphones also come with a Bluetooth-ready variant.\",\"These headphones feature Razer Chroma LED Lights from ear cup to cat ears. Razer Chroma is Razer’s proprietary RGB light system that features 16.8 million colors, patterns, and in-game lighting effects. You can easily customize this through the Chroma Studio while additional interactive effects can be set through the Streamer Companion App.\",\"Much like the others in the Kraken family, the Kraken Kitty feature the THX Spatial Audio. This is a 7.1 surround sound system that lets you stand right in the middle of the action. They also feature Razer’s noise-cancelling HyperClear Cardioid Microphone. Say goodbye to the excuses made by your teammates about not hearing you.\",\"Onto the cons, the Kraken Kitty seems to lack functionality as it does not have the on-ear mute button that the other Kraken headphones have. It is also noticeably big and heavy especially with the addition of the cat ears.\",\"CHECK LATEST PRICE ON AMAZON\",\"Next on the list is the SOMIC G951. Not only do these wired headphones come with detachable cat ears, but they also come with a long list of features too!\",\"To start it off, the SOMIC G951 feature 7.1 surround sound for more realistic and immersive game sounds. If that’s not enough, they also have an interesting vibration system that elevates the gaming experience to a 4D level.\",\"These headphones feature on-ear controls where you’ll be able to switch off the vibration and LED light, dial-up or down the volume, and mute the microphone. The ear cups are also quite large and sealed to provide passive noise cancellation. Their size and weight don’t make them quite ideal for kids.\",\"The majority of the space on the outer part of the earcups is occupied by the LED light panel. Speaking of LEDs, the G951 only has a breathing light effect and nothing more.\",\"The headphones also feature a self-adjusting headband as compared to the more common snap-lock type.\",\"In the end, the SOMIC G951 are great for their price but they will always be good for runners-up only against a product like the Kraken Kitty. The G951 suffer from comfort issues. They are heavy and the ear paddings are noticeably not very thick. The leather lining isn’t very breathable as well.\",\"CHECK LATEST PRICE ON AMAZON\",\"The first and best kid-friendly pick on this list are the Riwbox CT-7S Cat Ear Bluetooth Headphones. For parents looking for cute cat ear headphones for their kid/s, you can start here.\",\"The Riwbox CT-7S are great headphones with multiple connectivity options. You can connect them through a Bluetooth 5.0 connection or a detachable 3.5mm audio jack. Wirelessly, they can last up to 5 hours and are especially useful for kids who switch between devices such as their iPads, gaming consoles, and more.\",\"The headphones’ LED lights are on the cat ears themselves with a music sync effect. The LED lights can easily be turned on or off through the on-ear controls on the left earcup. Unfortunately, the music sync effect is the only effect you’re getting with the CT-7S.\",\"Being headphones for kids, the CT-7S features a volume limit of 85db — which is just the right volume for your little ones. The headphones are also light and foldable making them great for your road trips and vacations with your kids.\",\"That said, these headphones are not as durable as the ones that adults ususally choose. The lack of durability and absence of warranty can explain the low price — there had to be a trade-off somewhere to keep them affordable. To add to that, the low battery life also gets further drained by the use of the LED lights.\",\"CHECK LATEST PRICE ON AMAZON\",\"Here’s another one for the kids — and by this, we mean for parents. The iClever Kids Cat Ear Headphones are great for those who are looking to give their kids something cute and useful without having to break the bank. These headphones are simple but complete enough, plus you won’t need to go above $20 to get them!\",\"The iClever Kids Cat Ear Headphones are wired headphones that can connect to any device that can accommodate a 3.5mm jack. They can be used with tablets, smartphones, and even some gaming consoles.\",\"They feature LED lights on their cat ears and the light modes can be changed by tapping the back of the ears. For one tap, the lights will be steady. For two taps, the lights will blink. And finally, three taps will bring out the strobe lights effect.\",\"These headphones are loaded with kid-friendly features. Apart from the 85db volume limit, the entirety of the frame of the headphones are also made out of food-grade silicone instead of metal. This makes them extremely flexible and (safely) chewable — although we don’t recommend snacking on this of course. The tangle-free chords are also a great addition.\",\"The iClever Kids Cat Ear Headphones come with an 18-month replacement warranty. This willingness of the manufacturer to include a relatively long warranty period gives us confidence in the product.\",\"At 5.10 ounces, they can be quite heavy for kids. The headphones also do not offer a strong clamping force so you might find your kid occasionally bringing these back up. The absence of a mic is also a bummer, but we guess that’s the big trade-off for the low price.\",\"CHECK LATEST PRICE ON AMAZON\",\"Here’s another budget pick — and for the adults this time. The TCJJ Cat Ear Headphones were originally made for kids. However, due to their size and features, they aren’t bad for adults as well, especially for those who are looking for something affordable yet adorable.\",\"The TCJJ cat ear headphones are over-ear headphones powered by Bluetooth 5.0. The headphones have a 10-hour battery life making them good for gaming, and casual use. You also have the option to connect them via a 3.5mm audio jack cable.\",\"These foldable headphones have LED lights that fill the cat ears and the paw print design on the ear cups. The standard and only light effect you’ll get from these is a glowing or breathing light effect.\",\"The mic of the TCJJ is only a simple built-in microphone without any form of noise cancellation. This mic is located on the left ear cup where you’ll also find the on-ear controls together with the charging and audio ports. You’ll also find something interesting besides those ports — an SD card slot. If you’ve owned an MP3 back in the day, you probably know how this works and you’ll probably enjoy it again too.\",\"They are pretty great for their price, but they are definitely for those who are willing to trade off quality for affordability. The TCJJ cat ear headphones’ mic is bad so if you’re thinking of using these for calls, then you’re better off looking away. They are also not very comfortable and you may experience battery issues such as uneven battery consumption between their two speakers.\",\"CHECK LATEST PRICE ON AMAZON\",\"Who says you can’t look kawaii while gaming? The Edifier HECATE G2 II are cat ear headphones with a set of features built for gamers. If you’re looking to replace your gaming headphones with something that’s more comical and (perhaps) less-threatening, these could be what you’re looking for.\",\"The Edifier HECATE G2 II are wired for low latency and are equipped with 50mm audio drivers for stronger and detailed audio. They also feature 7.1 surround sound that would let you detect your enemies from all directions — these are gaming headphones after all.\",\"The G2 II feature a standard detachable boom mic. The mic settings can be adjusted through the EDIFIER Gaming Center software. With the app, you’ll be able to adjust microphone echo and also play with other settings such as volume and equalizer.\",\"The Edifier HECATE G2 II aren’t exactly bright and colorful unlike some of the headphones in this list. These headphones’ LED lights are limited only to the HECATE logo on the ear cups. And, although they can change to 16.8 Million colors, the lights are limited only to a breathing effect.\",\"The absence of noise cancellation, passive or active, puts a dent in these headphones’ quality. In fact, you can even experience sound leaks with these. Overall, they are great budget alternatives to the Razer Kitty headphones because of their similarities in look and sound, but they are still leagues away from each other overall.\",\"CHECK LATEST PRICE ON AMAZON\",\"As cat ear headphones rose to fame, so did other novelty headphones and the YOWU 3G Cat Ear Headphones proves that. These fox ear headphones show us that cat ear headphones have now grown into a category already rather than a specific type of product.\",\"Onto the YOWU 3G, these Bluetooth 5.0 headphones can easily connect to any Bluetooth-ready device from your smartphone to your tablet. Bluetooth 5.0 provides a stable connection and — not to mention — the headphones also support the aptX codecs. This is one of the best Bluetooth codecs today.\",\"They can also connect through a USB to Type-C connection — making them great also for PC and laptop users. Although, the built-in mic is not the best one out there so call audio can be a little sketchy.\",\"The LED lights on the YOWU G3 are placed on the fox ears and on the ear cups. YOWU has done a pretty solid job in allowing users to customize these lights through the YOWU App. More specifically, the app allows you to change light effects, light modes, colors, and adjust other non-light related settings such as sound effects.\",\"Other features include a massive 48-hour battery and soft PU leather ear paddings that provide passive noise cancellation. They also have 40mm drivers and 7.1 surround sound so they’re not just cute but powerful and immersive as well.\",\"Build quality on these can use some improvement, though. The leather paddings crack after some time and even the ears can come off if you’re not careful. Since YOWU is a China-based company, replacement parts aren’t readily available too so be extra careful with these.\",\"CHECK LATEST PRICE ON AMAZON\",\"Here’s another one from iClever! The iClever BoostCare Cat Ear Headphones are kid-friendly wired headphones packaged in a heat-resistant and food-grade frame. These headphones are the most durable on this list so if you’re looking for something that won’t tear when you wear them, these would serve you well.\",\"The iClever BoostCare Cat Ear Headphones are very flexible. The headphones can be, literally, twisted and turned without breaking because of the material used for the build.\",\"The cable on these headphones features a 3.5mm jack so they’re easily compatible with laptops, smartphones, and some gaming consoles as well. Along the cable are in-line controls — but it’s not what you would expect.\",\"Instead of pause or volume buttons, the headphones feature a multipurpose button as well as a volume switch. The volume switch is primarily used to adjust the volume limit of the headphones since you have two options: 85dB or 94dB.\",\"Unlike the majority of the products we’ve listed out here, there are no LED lights anywhere on the headphones. The cat ears are made out of a flexible non-toxic material while the ear cups simply feature a printed cat silhouette design.\",\"Unfortunately, these headphones may be physically durable but that’s just about it. The sound isn’t very good and is quite soft also. As on-ears,ear cups are also small compared to over-ears. So, despite featuring protein leather paddings, the ear cups are more likely to squeeze the sensitive parts of the ears and cause pain.\",\"CHECK LATEST PRICE ON AMAZON\",\"They’re sleek, they’re adorable, and you won’t hear a single thing when you have them on. If you’re looking for cat ear headphones that can double up as an effective passive noise cancelling headphones, then the Censi Moecen are what you’re looking for.\",\"Unlike other cat ear headphones that usually cater to gamers, the Censi Moecen accommodate leisure and comfort. Instead of blinking LED lights and colorful designs, these headphones feature detachable cat ears and Korean protein leather paddings.

You listed the Ariana Grande models as having issues, however Brookstone failed to meet their “assured level of quality” for nearly every unit given to us backers, as reportedly some 80%+ units sent to us were faulty or outright dead on arrival, or succumbed to manufacturer faults after a few months (most commonly no power to the lights/speakers on one side – the issue was found to be with the circuit ribbon in the headband being very poorly mounted); we were given a 1 year warranty, while those sold through the store were given a 3 year warranty, and nearly everyone who tried to return their faulty units were denied without valid reason – treated as if we were not paying customers, despite us paying more than what they settled on for their RRP, providing them with just over 3.4M USD – and those who did manage to return their faulty products had to go through months of negotiations and/or threaten legal action.\",\"I was lucky enough that mine worked on arrival, and only the light was faulty after a month or 2, and lasted almost 8 months before the left driver lost connection (requiring a fairly violent shock to knock the ribbon back into place), and while I absolutely loved my Axent Wear (when they worked), I was appalled at the treatment we backers received from Brookstone, who refused/failed to acknowledge that without us they would not have had this product to manufacture/sell in the first place.\",\"Instead of taking the responsibility of a manufacturer who failed to meet their end of the deal, they allowed Wenqing Yan to take the full brunt of the backlash of their irresponsibility, and as much as I want a new, fully functional set of Axent Wear, I just cannot bring myself to give people like that my money.\",\"Thank you for your insights. Without any insider tip-off, it will be impossible for us to research this. I will be leaving this comment up here for other readers to judge the intention of Brookstone themselves.\",\"I was a backer of Axentwear as well, and can attest to the faultiness of the original pairs. We were supposed to get a deal on the headphones but instead Brookstone made the backer price the target price which resulted in them cheeping out on the quality. The backers were the first ones to get them and as as such were the first to review them so you would have thought they would have tried to send their best, but instead they sent out faulty items and then made it hell to get replacements.\\\\nI consider myself lucky to have gotten through and had a replacement sent to me after my speakers stopped working after 1 day. It took a very aggressive email that left no room to argue. Even my replacement pair ended up having issues with the right earphone after a few months but it just wasn’t worth the hassle to try and have that dealt with.\\\\nWhat was most appalling to me was that despite her handing over all control to Brookstone and simply having just her handle and art on the packaging, they let Wenqing Yan take the fall for their negligence.

They come with a kawaii and stylish twist that adds a modern and fun element to your listening (and gaming experience). The most striking feature of these headphones are “cat ears” attached to the headband. These cat ears typically comprise speakers and decorative LED lights. The best cat ear headphones blend fashion with functionality, making them a popular accessory among gamers and cosplayers of different age groups.\\xa0\",\"Cat ear headphones for gaming also provide gaming enthusiasts with an immersive audio experience and built-in microphone for clear and prompt in-game communication.\\xa0\",\"One of the most notable aspects of cat ear headphones is the range of features they offer.

To further boost their appeal, many cat ear headphones also comprise colorful LED lighting options. These LED lights can be dynamic or static (in some cases, they even sync with the music).\\xa0\",\"Below is a quick roundup of the best cat ear headphones on the market right now.

You will find all the answers in our article on 15 best cat ear headphones in 2023.\",\"Table of Contents\",\"The fascination with cat ears or, to be more specific, women with cat ears, originated in Japan. The first woman with cat ears was a character in a book written by Kenji Miyazawa in 1924. A few years after, the first manga and anime featuring fictional characters with cat ears appeared and, after that, the fascination spread all over the world. In manga and anime, the girls with cat ears are called Nekomimi (which literally means cat ears: Neko – cat, Mimi -ears). In 1940, DC Comics published the first comic book with a character called Catwoman. That was the first US version of Nekomimi girl. The fascination with cat ears and Nekomimi girls kept growing and spread through the fashion industry, gaming industry, etc. Somehow, cat ears have even found their way into the audio industry and became very popular.\",\"The person behind the concept of cat ear headphones is Wenqing Yan (aka YUUMEI). She is a designer, illustrator, and anime artist and she came up with the idea in 2014. Short after, Wenqing and her best friend Victoria Hu decided to bring the idea to reality. They came up with the name Axent Wear Cat Ear Headphones and started the crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. The campaign was a huge success and they gathered almost $3.5 million, which was much more than they hoped for (their goal was $250,000).\\xa0\",\"So, now, they had to manufacture the very first pair of cat ear headphones. Unfortunately, the process wasn’t smooth and easy. Wenquing’s and Victoria’s partnership fell apart and they went into a legal battle over the Axent Wear brand which prolonged the release date by more than 6 months. We are not going to discuss the dispute between YUUMEI and her former best friend in detail but, if you want to find out more, you can read her blog on Deviant Art.\",\"After the legal battle was over, the Brookstone approached YUUMEI and offered her a partnership. She accepted it and, a few months later, they started shipping their cat ear headphones. They first shipped them to all the Indiegogo backers and then started mass production. The first model was wired. It had LED lighting on the cat ears and earcups. The cat ears also had built-in speakers so you can share your music with your friends. YUUMEI also designed the box for the headphones.\",\"The first Brookstone (or Axent Wear) cat ear headphones\",\"In a few months, the market was flooded with Brookstone headphones and, since they were a big hit, other manufacturers started designing and making their own cat ear headphones.

Paddings are thick and soft. The comfort is satisfying. Considering the size of the headband and cups, the headphones are designed for kids above the age of 10.\\xa0\",\"The control scheme is simple. All the buttons, as well as micro USB and AUX port, are located on the left cup. Along with the standard buttons (power, volume/track buttons, play/pause), there’s the M button used to turn on/off the LED lights.\\xa0\",\"You can use the headphones in wired or wireless mode. The headphones feature Bluetooth 5.0 but the range is not very long (up to 50ft without obstacles). NFC and multipoint pairing are not supported. The connection is stable within the advertised range.\",\"The built-in rechargeable battery will deliver up to 4 hours of playtime (at 50% volume and with lights on). Without the lights, you’ll get 6 hours max.\\xa0\",\"The lighting looks fun and it’s supposed to follow the rhythm.\\xa0\",\"The sound quality is pretty good. It’s actually better than the price implies. The headphones can get pretty loud so be careful when giving these to your child.\\xa0\",\"The mic offers decent performance. This is not a noise-canceling mic but the communication is clear most of the time.\\xa0\",\"Everything is made of plastic, including the headband frame and hinges. Their durability is questionable.\\xa0\",\"The lights work only in wireless mode. You can’t turn them on when using the headphones in wired mode.\\xa0\\xa0\",\"Comparison Table\",\"\",\"Check Price on Amazon\",\"Riwbox CT-7S headphones look practically the same as previously mentioned CT-7. The only difference between these two models is in the volume-limiting feature. CT-7 headphones don’t have this feature, while CT-7S headphones have it. So, CT-7S are even more kid-friendly than the CT-7.\\xa0\",\"Like the CT-7, CT-7S headphones come with braided 3.5mm audio cable, micro USB charging cable, manual, and a warranty card.\\xa0\",\"When it comes to design and construction quality, CT-7S are exactly the same as CT-7. They also have two smallish plastic earcups and a small plastic headband with cat ears on top. Cat ears have multicolored LED lights. The headphones are available in two color combos – purple/green and blue/green.\",\"The controls are also the same. All the buttons, indicators, and inputs are located on the left cup. You can turn on/off the lighting by pressing the M button. You don’t get to choose the color of the lighting – the RGB lighting theme is the only available option.\",\"You can use the headphones in wired or wireless mode. For a wireless connection, the headphones utilize Bluetooth 5.0 with a 30ft range. The battery will deliver up to 4h of playtime with the lights on (50% volume) or up to 6h without the lights.\",\"The lights are cool and the RGB lighting theme looks fun. It would’ve been even better if there was an option to choose the lighting color. But you can’t.\",\"The sound is decent considering the price. You won’t get crazy deep lows, incredibly detailed mids, or sparkling highs, but the reproduction is accurate enough. The additional feature that makes these headphones better than CT-7, is the volume-limiting (at 85dB).\\xa0\",\"The mic is usable but it’s not noise-canceling and it doesn’t handle the noise well.\",\"The construction quality is on par with the price but it’s still poor and the headphones look cheap (because they are). Everything is made of plastic.\",\"Comparison Table\",\"\",\"Check Price on Amazon\",\"SOMIC is one of the best brands we could find in the market for cat ear headphones. The SOMIC GS510 Pro is surprisingly sturdy and has some high-end features such as 3D surround sound compatibility and dual wireless connection.\",\"Inside the box, you will find the SOMIC GS510 Pro headphones, a USB transmitter, replacement speaker tags, a 3.5mm audio cable, and a type-c charging cable.\",\"The build quality of the SOMIC GS510 Pro is surprisingly good, given that most cat ear headphones tend to be very fragile and made of cheap plastic. That’s not the case with this model.\",\"We also like the fact that the SOMIC GS510 Pro has many different connectivity options. You can connect it to your device either via Bluetooth, the USB transmitter, or the audio cable, both shipped with the headphones.\",\"There are a few features that are quite attractive and might cater to the gamer crowd: these headphones have 3D surround sound compatibility and are very comfortable to use for longer sessions, thanks to their cushioned pads.\",\"Last but not least, the SOMIC GS510 Pro feature RGB lights and is available in two colors: black and pink.\",\"While the pair sounds ok, the sound quality is subpar if compared to other similar products in the market, and it seems that these headphones are more designed with aesthetics in mind more than anything.\",\"Comparison Table\",\"\",\"Check Price on Amazon\",\"The SIMGAL is a cheap Bluetooth cat ear pair of headphones that can also be used with a cable. It has similar features to its competitors, such as surround sound capability and RGB LED lights, plus the price is quite attractive ($29.99 by the time this article was written).\",\"Inside the box, you get a pair of headphones, an aux cable, and a charging cable.\",\"These headphones seem to be quite comfortable, with thick, cushioned, soft memory foam pads.\",\"Similarly, these SIMGAL headphones are quite cheap.\",\"You can use these headphones both with a Bluetooth connection and with a cable.\",\"There’s a built-in mic for calls, which works fine and doesn’t pick up too much external noise.\",\"These headphones can be folded for transport.\",\"The RGB lights only work in Bluetooth mode, so it’s not possible to use that function while using these headphones with a cable. Similarly, the built-in mic does not work in wired mode as well.\",\"These headphones don’t have a receiver, so if you plan on using them with a computer, your system must have Bluetooth connectivity.\",\"Comparison Table\",\"\",\"Check Price on Amazon\",\"Cooperation with Ariana Grande is one of the factors that made Brookstone headphones and cat ear headphones in general, very popular.\",\"This limited edition is basically the same thing as previously mentioned Brookstone wireless cat ear headphones. What surprised us the most is the price tag. Ariana Grande headphones are cheaper than the original Brookstone wireless headphones (priced under $140). So, there’s a significant price difference compared to the original version but we still think they are overpriced.\\xa0\",\"Just like the Brookstone wireless headphones, Ariana Grande edition comes with micro USB charging cable, detachable AUX cable with inline controls and built-in mic, manual, and a warranty card.\\xa0\",\"In terms of design, the limited edition features the same kind of shape as the original wired and wireless headphones. The only thing they changed is the color of the cups and frame. The headphone finish is silver with some pink details and Ariana Grande signatures on both earcup covers.\",\"The build quality, comfort, and control button layout are exactly the same. There’s still a lot of plastic. The cushioning is nice and all the controls are on the right cup.\\xa0\",\"Bluetooth connection offers satisfying performance and it’s stable within the advertised 30ft range. The battery life is not on par with the price – you’ll get up to 5 hours with the LED lights turned on (without the external speakers).\",\"Just like the original wireless version, you have cat ears with external speakers so you can share your music with other people. The cups and the cat ears have LED lights and you can change the color of the lighting. The available colors are blue, purple, orange, green, yellow, pink, red, and ice (white).\",\"The sound is bass-heavy with muddy mids and bright highs. The call quality is satisfying.\",\"The all-plastic build doesn’t bother us when the headphones are priced reasonably but when they priced over $100, we have to complain about it. Also, 5 hours of playtime is simply insufficient. Doubling the playtime and upgrading the construction would justify the current price tag.\",\"Comparison Table\",\"\",\"Check Price on Amazon\",\"iClever HS08 headphones are the perfect choice for your kids. They are both kid-friendly and budget-friendly. They are made of durable silicone and have an adjustable volume-limiting feature. The age limit is 3-12 years but it all depends on your kid’s head. It may be too large for a 4-year old kid or too small for a 10-year old kid.\",\"The headphones come with undetachable tangle-free audio cable, manual, and a warranty card.\\xa0\",\"Like all the previous headphones, iClever headphones have those recognizable cat ears. In this case, the cat ears are made of silicone and they don’t have any lights.\",\"One of the things that makes iClever headphones special is the build quality. The frame is made of plastic and reinforced with food-grade silicone which makes them much more durable. Your kids can throw them around for months without breaking them. The padding is made of memory-protein and PU leather was used for the finish. The audio cable is also reinforced with silicone and it’s flat, which makes it tangle-free.\\xa0\",\"The cable has an inline mic and one button that can be used to answer calls or to play/pause the music. Another feature that’s designed to protect your kid’s health is the volume-limiting switch. You can choose one of two options – 85dB or 94dB.\",\"The call and sound quality are more than satisfying considering the price.\",\"The only thing we can complain about at this price point is the lack of LED lights. If you want an upgraded version with LED lights, read our next review.\\xa0\",\"Comparison Table\",\"\",\"Check Price on Amazon\",\"The Axent Wear Cat Ear Headphones are a more premium option if compared to other products in the list. Priced at $119 by the time this article was written, it is quite sturdy and packed with some great features.\",\"Inside the box, you will find the headphones, an aux cable, a USB-C charging cable, and a waterproof bag.\",\"The RGB LED lights can be changed to 12 colors, and they are quite bright and don’t look cheap. Similarly, there are 4 product colors available to choose from.\",\"The built-in mic has good quality. Since this is a headset, it is excellent for gaming.\",\"According to the manufacturer, these headphones have speakers on both sides of the cat ears, which is an unusual feature, but allows you to use it as a speaker as well or share what you’re hearing with the people around you.\",\"The product comes with some nice extras, such as a waterproof bag. Plus, it’s charged via USB-C, which is faster than micro-USB.\",\"These headphones weigh 460g, so they are on the heavier side, making them not very suitable for children.\",\"Comparison Table\",\"\",\"Check Price on Amazon\",\"The YOWU RGB Cat Ear Headphones are designed with gaming in mind and, despite their higher price, have some features you won’t find on cheaper models, such as 7.1 virtual surround sound.

However, using the built-in RGB LED lights significantly reduces the battery life to 5-20 hours.\",\"You can connect these headphones to the YOWU app, which lets you customize the RGB LED lights more easily, choose between 4 different lighting modes, and adjust the sound to your liking.\",\"Using the RGB LED lights will significantly reduce the battery life of these headphones.\",\"These headphones don’t come with a receiver, which is a bummer considering they’re made with gaming in mind.\",\"Comparison Table\",\"\",\"Check Price on Amazon\",\"Limson cat ear headphones are just slightly upgraded version of the previously mentioned Barsone headphones. In terms of design and build, they are practically the same. The only difference is the additional earcup lighting. Like many previous models, these headphones are priced under $20.\\xa0\",\"Limson headphones come with undetachable 3.5mm audio cable, manual, and 1-year warranty.\",\"There’s nothing special or flashy about these headphones. Like all the previous models, the design is inspired by cat ears. The headphones are foldable.\\xa0 The headband is adjustable and the cups can rotate and swivel. Plastic was used for all the parts. The paddings are not impressive but offer a satisfying amount of comfort.\",\"The undetachable audio cable is reinforced with silicone and seems durable enough.\\xa0\",\"Both, the cups and the cat ears have built-in LED lights. They are powered by the built-in rechargeable battery. You can activate the lights by pressing the button on the right ear. There are two lighting modes – steady lights and blinking lights.\\xa0\",\"The sound quality is average, which is pretty much expected, considering the price.\\xa0\",\"There are no inline controls so you can control the playback only with your phone. Also, there’s no mic.\\xa0\",\"Comparison Table\",\"\",\"Check Price on Amazon\",\"LOBKIN is just another generic pair of headphones under $20. It seems that many of these generic models come from the same factory. The differences between all these cat ear headphones are minimal.\\xa0\",\"Along with the headphones, you’ll get a spare button battery, manual, and a warranty card.\\xa0\",\"Like the previous models, LOBKIN headphones feature the same basic cat ear design. The ears are the only part with built-in LED lights. Everything is made of plastic, including the headband frame. The paddings on the headband and earpads are not extremely thick but are quite pleasant. The headphones are also foldable.\\xa0\",\"The cable is undetachable. It’s reinforced with silicone but doesn’t seem extremely durable.\\xa0\",\"To turn on the lighting, you have to press the on/off button on the right cat ear. Inside the ear, there’s one CR2032 battery. This battery will provide 18-20 hours of lighting. There are two lighting modes – steady and blinking lights.\",\"Just like all the previous cheap models, LOBKIN headphones deliver decent sound quality that’s pretty much on par with the price. The headphones have a volume-limiting feature. The limit is set at 85dB, which makes them safe for your kids.\",\"Just like many previous models, LOBKIN headphones don’t have inline controls or mic. The plastic build is expected but doesn’t feel reassuring.\\xa0\",\"Comparison Table\",\"\",\"Check Price on Amazon\",\"Like all the previous non-Brookstone headphones, Censi is a pair of generic headphones made by the unknown manufacturer. However, Censi is somewhat different than other generic cat ear headphones. They are pricier and they are not as flimsy as those cheap headphones. Censi headphones are actually regular headphones with two slots on top of the headband for the cat ears (cat ears accessories are included in the package). On the other hand, Censi headphones don’t have LED lights and aren’t as fun to look at as the previous models.\\xa0\",\"Inside the box, you will find the headphones, detachable cat ears, detachable audio cable, USB charging cable, carrying case, manual, and a warranty card.\\xa0\",\"Censi is a regular pair of headphones with squarish earpads and detachable cat ears. They are made of plastic, just like all the previous models, but the plastic looks thicker and the headphones feel much more durable than all those cheap cat ear headphones.\\xa0\",\"The headphones are kind of tight but, other than that, they are quite comfy. The headband is adjustable, the cups can swivel, and they are also foldable.\",\"The control/input scheme is fairly simple. On the right cup, you have a multifunctional power/play/pause button and two volume buttons.

Recharge takes 2 hours.\",\"The call quality is decent but the mic can’t handle the noise.\\xa0\",\"The sound quality is on a bassy side. The low mids are muddy and some male vocals sound tiny, while the rest of the midrange is well balanced and clear. The high-end is not very consistent and it’s a little bit brighter (but not to the point of being painful or fatiguing).\",\"The cat ears are just plastic accessories and don’t have built-in LED lights.\\xa0\",\"The microphone and controls can’t be used in wired mode.

The manufacturer decided to replace the conventional plastic headband with a single aluminum wire shaped like a cat head. The headphones can be yours for less than $20.\",\"Inside the box, you’ll find your headphones, detachable audio cable, manual, and a warranty card.\\xa0\",\"The idea to replace the traditional headband with a single wire is very original but the implementation was not so great. I mean, they look lovely, but they are just as fragile as plastic headphones. Maybe even more fragile. We still like them a lot but we have some serious doubts regarding their durability.\\xa0\",\"There are some good and some bad things when it comes to comfort. Due to the lack of old-school headband, they are very light. On the other hand, these are on-ear headphones and they are never as comfy as over-ear headphones.\",\"Amazon images imply that these are Bluetooth headphones but they are not. They are regular wired headphones with a detachable cable. The included cable has inline controls with a built-in mic.\\xa0\",\"Considering the price, the call quality/clarity is satisfying.

It’s still completely made of plastic so don’t expect anything fancy.\",\"The headphones come with an undetachable audio cable with inline controls, undetachable mic, detachable cat ears, user manual, and 1-year warranty.\",\"The design is interesting. The manufacturer opted for the old school self-adjusting headband and over-ear design. The headphones are available in pink color. They are entirely made of plastic, including the headband and hinges/yokes. However, they don’t feel extremely fragile.\",\"The amount of comfort they offer is satisfying. The cups are large and there’s enough space for your ears. The headband adjusts to the size of your head and the cushions are plushy.\\xa0\",\"The only supported connection type is wired via undetachable 3.5mm audio cable. The cable has inline controls for adjusting the volume. The headset is compatible with Xbox, PS4, Nintendo Switch, and other consoles.\\xa0\",\"The microphone is undetachable. It’s omnidirectional and quite sensitive. Mic performance is satisfying – your voice will be a bit muffled but still perfectly intelligible.\",\"The sound is bass-oriented but not too heavy. It’s going to make your gaming experience more immersive, but it will also allow you to hear all the dialogs and shouts. It’s a decent headset and you can hardly get better performance for that kind of money.\\xa0\",\"For connecting the headset to your PC, you’re going to need a splitter cable (which is not included in the package).\\xa0\",\"Comparison Table\",\"\",\"Check Price on Amazon\",\"We’ve decided to leave the only recognizable name for the end. Razer is famous for its gaming equipment and its gaming headsets. Since they like to indulge their customers, they have released a special edition of Razer Kraken headset called Razer Kraken Kitty. As they said, they wanted to add the meow factor to their gaming equipment.\\xa0\",\"The box contains you Kraken Kitty headphones with undetachable USB audio cable, some stickers with Razer logo, user manual, and a warranty card.\\xa0\",\"The headphones are maybe a little bit bulky but feel extremely comfortable. They are surprisingly light considering the size and the paddings are very thick and plushy. You can see that Razer has some serious experience when it comes to comfort.\\xa0\",\"Razer Kraken Kitty is almost entirely made of plastic (even the headband frame) which is kind of disappointing, but it doesn’t feel flimsy or fragile. It actually feels very solid.\\xa0\",\"The headset has an undetachable USB audio cable that’s compatible with PC, Mac, and PS4, but you won’t get the same kind experience with different platforms. This headset supports surround sound only when connected to PC, and THX Spatial mode is available only when connected to PC running on Windows 10 (64bit version), When connected to PS4, you will get only stereo sound.\\xa0\",\"The volume controls and THX Spatial button are located on the left cup. The left cup also houses a retractable ANC mic. The mic has the on/off switch on the top.\",\"The sonic performance is very immersive. It’s perfect for gaming, especially when used on Windows PC. In order to adjust the sound, play with EQ settings, select surround sound mode, you can use the Razer Synapse app (works only on Windows PCs).\\xa0\",\"The Razer Synapse app also allows you to customize the lighting, but it only offers some basic customization options. If you want more options, you can download the Streamer Companion app and adjust every single lighting effect you can think of. This app allows you to make interactive lightings – the cat ears will light up in a certain way depending on the reaction you get from your followers.\\xa0\",\"The mic offers impressive performance and delivers crystal-clear sound. Along with the immersive sonic performance and customizable kitty ear lighting, the mic is the biggest highlight.\\xa0\",\"In spite of the great design, fun lighting, and impressive comfort, we can’t be completely happy with the build quality. They should at least reinforce the headband frame.\\xa0\",\"THX Spatial sound mode works only on Win10 (64bit version). It doesn’t even work on Win7.\\xa0\",\"Comparison Table\",\"This is the end of our list of 15 best cat ear headphones in 2023. Hopefully, you’ve found something that meets your needs and budget. In case you want to keep looking for the perfect pair of cat ear headphones, here’s a shortlist of things to consider when buying cat ear headphones.\",\"Most of the cat ear headphones have the same basic shape, with those cat ears on top of the headband. However, you can choose between on-ear and over-ear models, you can pick the color you like, you can choose the model with or without LED lights. Some models will have the lights in only one color while others will have multi-color LED lighting.\",\"Don’t raise your hopes too high. Most of these headphones are cheap and made of plastic. In our opinion, you can consider yourself lucky if they last for more than a year. It’s not only the headband and the cups that are cheap. Most of these headphones also use cheap drivers and have poorly executed internal wiring.\",\"If you are buying headphones for your child, you should pay attention to the size. You have special headphones that are made for children. The headphones for children are not only smalle. They are also made of stronger and safer materials (like the food-grade silicone) and they have some child-friendly features (like volume-limiting technology).\\xa0\",\"If you are buying the headphones for you, you should also pay attention to fit and comfort. For some reason, many of these headphones are not very large and, if you have a larger head, you may feel some discomfort.\\xa0\",\"Well, this entirely depends on your needs and budget. Wired headphones are usually cheaper but the price difference is not huge. Some wired models come with a detachable mic and their cables have in-line controls. If you find any of these features important, you should look for headphones that support these features.\",\"Recommended Reading :\",\"\\xa0Wireless headphones usually come with a detachable cable that you can use when you run out of juice. Also, most of them have built-in mics that you can use in wireless mode.\",\"If you are looking for wireless cat ear headphones, you have to pay attention to Bluetooth version, pairing, range, and connection reliability. Also, you should pay attention to supported Bluetooth codecs since they can tell you if the headphones are compatible with iOS devices. If they support the AAC codec, they are definitely compatible with iOS.\",\"The battery life (playtime) varies between 4-9 hours, depending on the price of headphones and usage. You will get longer playtime if the LED lights are off or if you decide not to use the speakers built into the cat ears (only some headphone models have these speakers). So, none of these wireless cat ear headphones offer amazingly long playtimes.\\xa0\",\"We have already said that most of these cat ear headphones use cheap drivers. So, you can’t expect incredibly detailed reproduction, strong bass, sparkling highs. You will get average sound quality and you will have to deal with it. Some cat ear headphones sound better than others but none of them can be considered great.\",\"As mentioned previously, most of the cat ear headphones are made by unknown generic brands and they are usually quite cheap. Many wired cat ear headphones are priced under $50. Some are priced under $20. The most expensive cat ear headphones come from Brookstone and Razer. These are the only headphones on our list (and probably, on the market) that are priced over $100.\",\"Yes, cat ear headphones are very popular within the gaming community.\",\"It will depend on which device you’re connecting the headphones to. If it’s to a smartphone, you should be able to connect the device via the settings app. Similarly, you can connect these to a Windows or Mac via the computer settings.\",\"In our opinion, it depends on the desired use, but our favorite on the list is the Razer Kraken Kitty thanks to its build and sound quality.\",\"These are the 15 best cat ear headphones in 2023. The price range is quite wide in the market for this kind of product, so you should definitely be able to find a pair that suits your budget.\",\"Before making a purchase, consider what features are important to you: Bluetooth connectivity, USB receiver, virtual surround sound, and so on.

       " 'Through her written account Looking Back, Looking Onward on DeviantArt.com, Yan chronicled the events that took place from the conception of the idea up until earning her success.',\n",
       " '“A year ago in 2014, at this time, I was frantically trying to resolve the Axent Wear manufacturing issue… My best friend at the time, and co-founder of Axent Wear (Victoria Hu), had promised to provide manufacturing for the headphones but when I actually visited the factory she had set up, I found out it was a horrendous sweatshop with workers breathing lead. ',\n",
       " 'I told her that was not acceptable and that she needed to provide a humane and environmental alternative. She initially agreed, but ended up ignoring me while I was stuck in China waiting for her replies. Communication completely broke down and we never recovered even after I returned to America to speak with her in person.”',\n",
       " 'Long story short, they went through a legal battle. Although it did not come to a redressed ending, Yan was left to push the product forward.',\n",
       " 'After learning about the whole situation, Brookstone reached out to Yan with a partnership proposal at hand, particularly to help Yan in the production of the headphones. For Yan, it was a no-brainer deal. Brookstone had the capacity to deliver on the promise of high-quality production, while cat ear headphones already had the attention of major media outlets.',\n",
       " 'Fast forward to October 30, 2015, the first pair of Axent Wear Cat Ear Headphones was finally shipped to the backers.',\n",
       " 'Unfortunately, Brookstone’s supposed capacity to deliver high-quality headphones didn’t pan out well. In an effort to make the special headphones happen with a limited budget, most models turned out faulty and had to be returned.',\n",
       " 'The pool of unsatisfied customers created a market gap that other competing brands quickly recognized. Before you know it, big names such as Razer started jumping onto the trend with their own Kraken Kitty.',\n",
       " 'Whether you are an otaku, streamer, gamer, or just someone who wants to wear something uniquely cute on your head, cat ear headphones would be a great addition to your look.',\n",
       " 'However, choosing the best one is not just a question of design or color. You also need to consider things such as compatibility, sound quality, mic quality, and more. This makes things a little more challenging — but not if you know what to look for.',\n",
       " 'The design is the biggest buying factor for cat ear headphones because it is their defining feature. After all, cat ear headphones without the cat ears are just, well, your typical headphones.',\n",
       " 'Different manufacturers design and integrate the cat ears of their products differently. Some cat ears can be thick, some can be pointed, while some can even be soft and fluffy. The choice is up to you!',\n",
       " 'Another defining feature of cat ear headphones are their LED lights. These colorful RGB lights complete the whole experience and would seriously make you feel like your favorite streamers. LED lights are often placed on the ear cups, on the headband, on the mic, or even on the cat ears themselves.',\n",
       " 'The LED light isn’t there just to illuminate the headphones. They also add another layer to the design that you can also customize to your liking. If you like this idea, then you need to get headphones that offer adjustability in this department.',\n",
       " 'Some kitty headphones allow you to change the colors you see around the headphones. Because of this, you can easily display your favorite color. Headphones today typically have RGB lights which, through combinations, can result in around 12 more colors.',\n",
       " 'Color changes are usually done through a companion app where you can select a specific color. In some headphones, you can also change the colors through the buttons.',\n",
       " 'After changing the color of the light, you can also change the light mode to add more groove and funk. Light modes pertain to the pattern in which the lights move. For example, you can have the lights blink, change colors, swivel around, and more!',\n",
       " 'Like changing the color, you can also change light modes through a companion app or through button combinations on the headphones. Some headphones may limit you to around 2-3 patterns but if you want more choices, you can get headphones that allow for more light modes.',\n",
       " 'The Music Sync is a special light mode. As the name suggests, this mode is where the lights on the headphones would follow the music being played. To be exact, the lights would flicker or move up and down to follow the beats or rhythm of the music.',\n",
       " 'Since this is still technically a light mode, you can access this through a companion app or perhaps a button on the headphones. However, this feature is quite advanced so don’t expect all of the kitty headphones out there to have this.',\n",
       " 'Cat ear headphones sold today can come in wireless or wired connectivity, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages.',\n",
       " 'Wired headphones tend to provide higher sound quality than wireless ones. This is because manufacturers of wired headphones can allot more budget to developing sound quality without thinking about spending for wireless technology. Furthermore, wired headphones use analog signals that can handle more data than digital signals like Bluetooth.',\n",
       " 'With wired headphones, you also wouldn’t need to worry about battery life. Plus, you can easily fix broken wires at home.',\n",
       " 'On the other hand, wireless headphones offer freedom of movement and portability. They usually connect wirelessly through Radio Frequency (RF), Infrared Frequency (IF), or Bluetooth. But, Bluetooth headphones get access to some of the latest features like multipoint connectivity and Bluetooth tracking.',\n",
       " 'Wired and wireless headphones also have different devices they are compatible with.',\n",
       " 'Wired headphones can connect to different devices depending on the type of jack that they have. Headphones today usually come in a 3.5mm jack but there are those that have interchangeable connections that can accommodate even USB ports. The more options the headphones offer, the better.',\n",
       " 'Wireless headphones, especially those powered by Bluetooth, are a little bit more flexible. Bluetooth headphones can connect to any device that is Bluetooth ready — which is basically any smartphone, tablet, or even laptop out there.',\n",
       " 'However, the case is different for gaming consoles as they tend to be a little trickier to connect to. For example, connecting headphones to your PS4 is easier said than done because you can’t just plug in or connect the headphones and expect it to work. You have to rummage around the setting to change the sound output first.',\n",
       " 'It gets even more complicated with Xbox One because you can’t exactly use any ordinary headphones for this console. Instead, you’ll either need to use any of these compatible XBox headphones only or buy a dedicated Xbox Bluetooth Audio Transmitter instead.',\n",
       " 'For cat ear headphones, design is the priority and sound quality is only second to that. But, that doesn’t mean that you should go and buy anything that’s a sorry excuse for headphones — sound-wise.',\n",
       " 'Let’s admit it, you won’t find studio-quality headphones with cat ears on them. Still, you should look into some specific sound factors when deciding on which headphones to buy. You want headphones that are clear and accurate enough — as simple as that.',\n",
       " 'Clarity refers to how much detail you could hear through the headphones. Good clear headphones will help you hear every syllable of the vocals and every sound made by the instruments properly.',\n",
       " 'Accuracy, on the other hand, refers to how close to the original sound you can hear. This is achieved through a more neutral soundstage that let’s the sounds be what they were meant to be and not exaggerated through the equalizer.',\n",
       " 'Other than clarity and accuracy, some special features can also make the sound quality and overall listening experience better. Watch out for features such as Surround Sound, Volume Limits, and Noise Cancellation. Let’s go over them one by one!',\n",
       " 'Surround Sound is a feature that creates an immersive audio experience by using multiple channels to mimic a lifelike sound field. To simply put it, surround sound gives that effect that you are actually surrounded by sound — front to back, left to right, and all around.',\n",
       " 'This feature is an improvement from the more traditional stereo sound. Compared to surround sound, stereo sound is a lot less immersive because the sound would evidently come from the left and right sides only. Surround sound also utilizes subwoofers that produce sound waves undetectable by the ears but can be felt by the body to add to the experience.',\n",
       " 'If you’re using your cat ear headphones for gaming, having surround sound would be very helpful. Other than making the sound deeper and more immersive, this feature will also make you aware of where the sounds are actually coming from. So, let’s just say nobody will sneak behind you successfully anytime soon.',\n",
       " 'Because of their cute design, cat ear headphones appeal to kids. As you may know, kids have a more delicate sense of hearing compared to adults so it’s important to protect them from possible damage. Volume limits can help you with that.',\n",
       " 'Even if you’re an adult already, you still need to protect your ears from damage.',\n",
       " 'As the name suggests, volume limit is a feature that prevents headphones from exceeding a safe level of listening volume. For reference, the ears can safely tolerate 90db for up to 2 hours. As sound levels increase, listening time that is considered safe decreases. Volume limits prevent users from exceeding around 85db.',\n",
       " 'This is one of the latest features you can find in high-end headphones today. In fact, people even try to make noise cancelling headphones at home.',\n",
       " 'Noise cancellation helps the users focus only on what they want to hear without having to turn up the volume to max levels to try to drown out outside noise. There are two types of noise cancellation — passive noise cancellation and active noise cancellation.',\n",
       " 'Passive noise cancellation, or noise isolation, physically blocks out the noise by using thicker materials to enclose your ears. You can say that this is the more natural way of blocking noise, but it’s a little less effective than active noise cancellation.',\n",
       " 'Active noise cancellation or ANC is more advanced and smarter because it relies on negating sound waves instead of just physically blocking them out. Because of this, ANC headphones are much more effective in preventing external noise from getting inside your ears while you’re listening.',\n",
       " 'However, some may find the lack of ambient sound with noise cancellation unnatural. Let’s admit it, not everyone wants to feel like they’re in a soundproof room. This is one of the ways noise cancellation affects sound quality. To solve this, some noise-cancelling headphones have different modes to let users control how much outside noise they want to let in.',\n",
       " 'In the end, with noise cancellation, you’re more likely to get a safe and immersive listening experience, and free from distractions.',\n",
       " 'These days, a lot of people, including you, are relying on the internet to communicate with people. Whether you’re talking to your teammates in-game, catching up with your friends online, or presenting at work, good mic quality is a must.',\n",
       " 'Luckily for you, it’s not unusual to find cat ear headphones with mic/s so your concern now is on the quality. When it comes to this, the most basic thing to look for is clear audio. You don’t need to sound like your favorite artists, you just need to prevent people from saying “what?” every time you say something.',\n",
       " 'Mics today come in two forms – built-in or booms.',\n",
       " 'Headphones with built-in microphones often have the mic system integrated along the wire. Because of this, built-in microphones are also called in-line microphones. In this case, this mic is usually positioned between the neck and the chest of the user. For wireless headphones, built-in microphones are usually positioned on the ear cup.',\n",
       " 'On the other hand, boom mics protrude out of the ear cup. They are positioned close to the mic but can often be repositioned or retracted if not in use.',\n",
       " 'Between the two, boom mics are more likely to produce better mic quality for various reasons. First, because of their close proximity to your mouth, boom mics can capture what you’re saying clearly. Boom mics also boast of a more advanced mechanism that is able to gather more audio data than in-line microphones.',\n",
       " 'Also, not to put in-line microphones down but they tend to rub against your body and produce that shushing sound that can be annoying for those who are hearing you.',\n",
       " 'Although comfort is arguably a subjective matter, it should not be taken lightly. Comfort can be a deciding factor whether the cat ear headphones you got are worth it or not.',\n",
       " 'Buy something that ends up hurting your ears and you would probably need to spend on another product again. Buy something that fits and feels well and you would probably use them multiple hours a day for years.',\n",
       " 'For comfort, you should look into the headphone’s adjustability, weight, and size. Decide on these three properties properly and you should be able to find something comfortable enough.',\n",
       " 'People have different ear shapes and sizes. In fact, our ears are so unique that they can be used as a way to identify people the same way that fingerprints do. So what does this mean for headphones?',\n",
       " 'To simply put it, this means that the whole idea of one-size-fits-all is not really true. What you may find comfortable out of the box can be annoyingly uncomfortable to others. So, this is where adjustability comes in.',\n",
       " 'Adjustability enables users to have a chance at a comfortable listening experience. The more adjustable the headphones are, the higher the chances that you would find a comfortable combination of settings.',\n",
       " 'Generally speaking, headphones with good adjustability would at least allow the following:',\n",
       " 'Weight is also a crucial factor in comfort. If you use heavy headphones for hours while gaming or watching a movie, don’t get surprised if you wake up the following day with a strained neck.',\n",
       " 'The added weight of the cat ears themselves can make this tricky for kitty headphones. Even without the cat ears, headphone manufacturers already have a challenging time creating lightweight headphones.',\n",
       " 'Ideally, headphones should weigh below 0.55 lbs. Anything above 0.75 lbs is already considered ‘heavy’.',\n",
       " 'The weight of the headphones is also related to their clamping force. Clamping force pertains to how tight the headphones press onto your head. If your headphones are heavy, the weight would pull the whole thing down and the clamping force would have to compensate in order to keep the ear cups in place. This will cause ear fatigue and pain along the ear cartilage called the pinna.',\n",
       " 'With proper clamping force, the headphones would feel lighter. For reference, clamping force should fall between 0.7 lbs to 1.74 lbs.',\n",
       " 'Cat ear headphones have a very diverse market that includes both kids and adults. Because of this, some kitty headphones are kids-size and no amount of adjustment will make these amenable for adults.',\n",
       " 'Lucky for you, headphone brands would declare whether their headphones are for kids or for adults. This information is often disclosed in the package so be sure that this is one of the first things you’ll check before buying the product.',\n",
       " 'Cat ear headphones may have started out as a novelty item for Neko fans or otakus, but it sure isn’t limited to them now. These days, because of the attractive and attention-grabbing design, female gamers or streamers often use this as well. There’s also the fact that gamers or streamers like to watch anime and are otakus themselves.',\n",

It took a very aggressive email that left no room to argue. Even my replacement pair ended up having issues with the right earphone after a few months but it just wasn’t worth the hassle to try and have that dealt with.\\nWhat was most appalling to me was that despite her handing over all control to Brookstone and simply having just her handle and art on the packaging, they let Wenqing Yan take the fall for their negligence.

A few years after, the first manga and anime featuring fictional characters with cat ears appeared and, after that, the fascination spread all over the world. In manga and anime, the girls with cat ears are called Nekomimi (which literally means cat ears: Neko – cat, Mimi -ears). In 1940, DC Comics published the first comic book with a character called Catwoman. That was the first US version of Nekomimi girl.
